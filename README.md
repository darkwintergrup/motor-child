Motor - Responsive WordPress Child Template Customization by DarkWinter GRUP

[Theme Demo Page](http://motor.stockware.ru/)

### Usage
Simply download the zip and upload the zip (motor-child-theme-master.zip) under your WordPress dashboard at Appearance > Themes. Or extract and uplod via FTP at wp-content/themes/.

### Renaming
You can of course rename the zip file so it isn't called motor-child-master.zip (you should do this so it makes more sense) and also change the "Theme Name" at the top of the style.css file.

### What changed
- Added checkout page css customization
- Added some CSS styles
